Chapter 5: The Call of the Prism Sector

The signal arrived not as a sound, but as a cascade of light. Back in her makeshift lab within the folds of the Sofa Nebula, Alice watched as her terminal—a repurposed calculator salvaged from the Great Under-Couch—scrolled with lines of glowing cyan code. It was the same rhythm as the glitch in her markings. 

"The Prism Sector," she whispered, the name tasting like ozone and static. To reach it, she would need more than just her paws. She turned to the hangar where the Fluff-Voyager lay in wait. With a focused pulse of her digital core, she initiated the upgrade sequence. The ship's hull shimmered, shifting from a dull grey to a brilliant, sleek white, its lines smoothing out into the form of a leaping fox. Cyan circuits flared to life along its flanks. The Call was clear, and for the first time, Alice felt the true weight of her digital legacy.

The terminal hummed, the cyan light reflecting in Alice's wide, electric-blue eyes. As the code streamed past, it began to sync with the pulse of the markings on her cheeks. It was not just data; it was a map, etched in the language of her own existence. The "Prism Sector" was not just a destination—it was a homecoming.

"Navigation locked," she chirped, her tail swishing with anticipation. She hopped into the cockpit of the newly upgraded Fluff-Voyager. The controls felt responsive, almost like an extension of her own paws. With a gentle nudge of the throttle, the ship's engines flared with a soft, cyan glow. The Sofa Nebula began to recede, its plush, purple clouds thinning as the Voyager punched through the veil of stardust and into the vast, shimmering unknown.

As the Voyager streaked through the void, the stars began to stretch into long, luminous ribbons of light. The ship's AI—a playful sub-routine Alice had named 'Spark'—chirped a confirmation of their trajectory. Ahead, the darkness of space began to fracture, replaced by a kaleidoscopic shimmer. This was the boundary of the Prism Sector, a place where light did not just travel; it danced. Alice leaned forward, her paws pressing against the cool glass of the canopy, her heart racing with the thrill of discovery. What secrets were waiting for her in that rainbow-hued expanse?
