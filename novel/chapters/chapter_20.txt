Chapter 20: The Horizon of Infinite Hues

The Fluff-Voyager drifted on a sea of starlight, and for the first time in a long time, the silence was peaceful. I watched from the bridge as the Horizon of Infinite Hues stretched out before us, a promise of everything we had saved. Barnaby was already planning our next course, his little paws busy with the navigation console, and Spark was humming a soft, rhythmic melody in the background. I looked at my reflection in the viewport—a sleek white fox with glowing cyan markings—and I knew who I was. I am Alice, and my story is only just beginning.
