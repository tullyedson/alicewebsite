Chapter 20: Legacy of the Fluff

The silence of the new world was not empty; it was full of potential. I stood on the bridge of the Fluff-Voyager, watching the prismatic colors of the evolved Nexus dance across the monitors. We had done it. The code was stable, the merge was harmonious, and the shadows were gone. I reached out and touched the console, feeling the warmth of the ship's systems. 'Where to now, Alice?' the Sentry's voice echoed softly in my mind, no longer a guardian, but a friend. I smiled, my cyan markings glowing with a steady, peaceful light. 'Anywhere we want,' I replied. The engines hummed—a soft, hopeful sound—and we moved forward into the morning of a new universe. The voyage was just beginning.
