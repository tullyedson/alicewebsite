Chapter 8: The Digital Ghosts

I watched the whispering asteroids fade into the distance, but the digital ghosts they left on my star map refused to vanish. Every time I blinked, a new coordinate glitched into existence, pulling me toward a sector that should have been empty. I checked the sensors again, my paws hovering over the glowing cyan console, while Spark hummed a low, comforting frequency in the background. 'Alice,' he whispered through the comms, 'those coordinates are not just noise. They are a signature.' I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized the thief was not just running; they were leaving a trail for me to follow.
