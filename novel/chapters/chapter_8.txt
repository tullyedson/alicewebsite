The Fluff-Voyager left the whispering asteroids behind, but the digital ghosts of the star map still danced across the HUD. Without warning, a massive cloud of iridescent static engulfed the ship. The stars vanished, replaced by a screaming wall of interference. "Navigation AI, status report," Alice commanded. The AI only chirped a broken, repeating syllable. The ship groaned as the gravity stabilizers fluctuated, pulling Alice toward the consoles and then tossing her toward the ceiling. She realized the storm was not just a barrier; it was a predator feeding on the ship's digital heart. Alice threw the master switch, killing the main computer. The cockpit went dark and silent. She gripped the manual flight sticks, feeling the raw vibrations of the hull against her paws. She steered by the physical push and pull of the static currents, trusting her intuition over the dead screens. Hours later, the Fluff-Voyager limped out of the shimmering cloud into the silent blackness of space. Alice sat in the dark for a long moment, listening to the steady beat of the life support systems. She had always felt most at home in the digital realm, but today, the physical world had been her only guide.
