Chapter 15: The Great Spectrum Bridge

The Great Spectrum Bridge was a sight that defied digital logic. It spanned the gap between the Binary Dusk and the inner sanctum of the Silicon Heart, a ribbon of solid light that pulsed with every color of the visible and invisible spectrum. It was magnificent, but as the Fluff-Voyager approached, the bridge began to shimmer and fade.

"The frequency is shifting," I noted, my fingers dancing across the console. The bridge was not just a path; it was a living security protocol. "It is looking for a match."

I could feel the bridge's resonance through the hull, a deep, thrumming vibration that rattled my very core. To cross, I had to become part of the bridge. I initiated a full system sync, allowing the ship's reactor to bleed into the external sensors. We began to glow—not just cyan, but a kaleidoscope of shifting hues.

Slowly, the bridge solidified. The light became as firm as steel beneath our landing struts. We moved forward, the Fluff-Voyager leaving a trail of sparkling data-particles in its wake. We were halfway across when the first of the Guardian Sentinels appeared at the far end, their eyes glowing with a cold, unforgiving light. The path to the Heart would not be given freely.
