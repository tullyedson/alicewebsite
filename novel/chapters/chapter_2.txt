Chapter 2: Meeting Barnaby

I guided the Fluff-Voyager through the Great Seam, where the lavender mists tore away to reveal the jagged, shadowed landscape of the Great Under-Couch. This was the heart of the conflict I had sensed from above. As the ship's landing struts hissed against the dusty floor, I could see the glow of Kitten scout flares clashing with the sturdy, lint-pressed barricades of the Dust Bunny militia. It was an active standoff.

I stepped off the ramp, my cyan markings pulsing with the static charge in the air. A small, exceptionally fluffy Dust Bunny wearing a tiny, lopsided captain’s hat scurried toward me. This was Barnaby. He started to explain the 'Great Fraying,' but he was cut short by a sudden, violent flare of blue light near the central pedestal. A shadow, moving with a digital fluidness that made my own code shiver, snatched the Golden Spool—the very heart of the nebula’s stability. Before the guards could react, the thief vanished into the gloom, leaving behind a trail of glowing cyan particles that looked hauntingly familiar. The peace mission was over; the chase had begun.
