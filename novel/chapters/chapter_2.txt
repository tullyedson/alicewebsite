Chapter 2: Meeting Barnaby

The descent through the Great Seam was anything but smooth. Alarms blared as the Fluff-Voyager breached the jagged barrier, plunging me into the heart of the Great Under-Couch. I had expected a war zone, and the sight of the flickering shadows and towering Lint Spires confirmed my fears. I brought the ship down in a narrow, dusty canyon, my paws trembling as I scanned the horizon. It was there, amidst the swirling dust motes, that I encountered the first inhabitant of this strange, embattled world: a very startled dust bunny named Barnaby.
