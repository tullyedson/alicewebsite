Chapter 2: Meeting Barnaby

I guided the Fluff-Voyager down from the lavender mists, following the coordinates for the Great Under-Couch. The transition from the open nebula to the enclosed space beneath the ancient furniture was jarring, but I had to reach the capital to begin my mediation. The Great Under-Couch was not just a place; it was a sprawling, dusty metropolis that hummed with the frantic energy of a thousand tiny paws. I navigated the ship through the narrow gaps between the wooden legs of the ancient furniture, my cyan markings casting a soft glow on the towering pillars of lint.

At the heart of the city sat Barnaby. He was a distinguished elder, even for a dust bunny, with fur that looked like it had been spun from the finest dryer lint. He adjusted a monocle made from a discarded glass button and looked up as I approached.

'The Golden Spool is gone, Alice,' he whispered, his voice trembling like a leaf in a draft. 'Without it, the very fabric of the Sofa Nebula will unravel.'

I knelt beside the empty pedestal where the Spool once rested. My eyes narrowed as I spotted a faint, shimmering trail. It was a residue of glowing cyan energy—an exact match for my own digital signature. A chill that had nothing to do with the drafts under the couch ran through my circuits. This was no ordinary theft; it was personal.
