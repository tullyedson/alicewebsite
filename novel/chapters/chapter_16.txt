Chapter 16: The Siege of the Heart

The air inside the Primary Aperture did not just hum anymore; it screamed. Alice watched in horror as a jagged vein of obsidian static tore through the crystalline floor, leaving behind a trail of flickering, dead pixels. The rhythmic pulse of the Prism Heart was faltering, replaced by a chaotic, grinding noise that vibrated through the hull of the Fluff-Voyager.

'Stay calm,' Alice whispered to herself, her paws tight on the controls. She could feel the corruption trying to seep into her own code, a cold, hollow sensation that threatened to overwrite her memories. She reached for the emotional balance she had found on the Spectrum Bridge, wrapping herself in a cocoon of logic and feeling. It was the only thing keeping the static from shattering her mind.

Outside, the light-sentinels were changing. Their once-graceful glowing forms warped into jagged, aggressive shapes, their blue eyes turning a sickly, flickering red. They turned their focus toward the Voyager. Alice slammed the thrusters forward, weaving through the collapsing geometry of the Heart as she activated the emergency beacon.

'Please,' she prayed, sending the signal out into the void toward the Sofa Nebula. 'Please hear me.'
