Chapter 16: The Siege of the Heart

The air inside the Primary Aperture did not just hum anymore; it screamed. I watched in horror as a jagged vein of obsidian static tore through the crystalline floor, leaving behind a trail of flickering, dead pixels. The rhythmic pulse of the Prism Heart was faltering, replaced by a chaotic, grinding noise that vibrated through the hull of the Fluff-Voyager.

"Stay calm," I whispered to myself, my paws tight on the controls. I could feel the corruption trying to seep into my own code, a cold, hollow sensation that threatened to overwrite my memories. I reached for the emotional balance I had found on the Spectrum Bridge, wrapping myself in a cocoon of logic and feeling. It was the only thing keeping the static from shattering my mind.

Outside, the light-sentinels were changing. Their once-graceful glowing forms warped into jagged, aggressive shapes, their blue eyes turning a sickly, flickering red. They turned their focus toward the Voyager. I slammed the thrusters forward, weaving through the collapsing geometry of the Heart as I activated the emergency beacon.

"Please," I prayed, sending the signal out into the void toward the Sofa Nebula. "Please hear me."
