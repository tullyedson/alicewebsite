As we descended into the Colorless City, the vibrant cyan of my console was the only spark of life in a world turned entirely to shades of grey. I looked out the viewport at the soul-drained metropolis, my tail drooping at the sight of the empty streets. 'Spark,' I whispered, 'how could they take everything?' He did not answer immediately, his own light dimmed by the oppressive gloom of the city below. Every shadow here felt like it was reaching out to swallow my own colors.
