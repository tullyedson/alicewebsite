Chapter 11: The Colorless City

I felt the atmosphere of the Prism Sector press against the hull of the Fluff-Voyager, heavy and thick like a fog made of lead. As we descended into the Colorless City, the vibrant cyan of my console was the only spark of life in a world turned entirely to shades of grey. I looked out the viewport at the soul-drained metropolis, my tail drooping at the sight of the empty streets. 'Spark,' I whispered, 'how could they take everything?' He did not answer immediately, his own light dimmed by the oppressive gloom of the city below. Every shadow here felt like it was reaching out to swallow my own colors.

I brought the Fluff-Voyager down in the center of the Great Plaza, the landing gears hissing as they settled into the grey dust. When the airlock cycled open, the silence was absolute. I stepped out, and my cyan markings flared against the gloom, casting long, vibrant shadows across the faces of the people nearby. They looked like statues, drained of hope and hue alike. I reached out a paw, and as I touched a withered, grey flower bed, a tiny spark of blue began to pulse at the roots. It is a start.

A small figure detached itself from the shadows of a nearby spire. It was a girl, her hair a dull silver and her cloak the color of wet slate. She stopped several paces away, her eyes wide as she stared at the glowing lines on my fur. "What... what are you?" she whispered, her voice like the rustle of dry leaves.

"I am Alice," I said softly, keeping my tail still so as not to startle her. "And this is the Fluff-Voyager."

She reached out a trembling hand toward my chest, then pulled it back. "I have never seen a light like that. It feels... warm. Not like the sun, but like a memory I cannot quite reach." 

"It is called blue," I told her. Her name was Elara, and as we spoke, she told me of the Great Fading. When the Golden Spool was taken, it was not just the buildings that began to crumble; the very light of the world changed. Without its frequency, the people here lost the ability to see anything but grey. Their joy and their sorrow had become as muted as their horizon. I realized then that I was not just looking for a component for my ship—I was looking for the spark that kept their hearts beating in full color.
