Chapter 11: The Colorless City

The atmosphere of the Prism Sector felt heavy, like a thick fog that had forgotten how to lift. As Alice piloted the Fluff-Voyager through the clouds, the vibrant violets and teals of the Sofa Nebula felt like a distant dream. Below her, the Colorless City stretched out in endless gradients of ash and charcoal. Grey spires reached upward like frozen fingers, and the streets were silent, occupied only by the listless Grey-Keepers.

Alice landed the ship in the central square. The landing struts hissed as they met the cold, stone ground. When the hatch opened, the air smelled of dust and ancient stone. She stepped out, her white fur a stark contrast to the gloom. There, she met Elara, a young girl whose eyes were as dull as the pebbles at her feet.

"Why is everything so dark?" Alice asked softly.

"It is not dark," Elara replied, her voice a hollow whisper. "It is just... empty."

Alice looked at the glowing cyan markings on her own paws. She realized then that the Golden Spool was the heartbeat of this world. Without it, the pulse of life had stopped. She knew what she had to do. She returned to the cockpit and initiated the external projection sequence.

A beam of pure, electric blue light erupted from the Fluff-Voyager, cutting through the grey like a diamond through glass. The Grey-Keepers stopped. They stared. For the first time in their lives, they saw a color. They saw Blue.

Elara stepped forward, her hand trembling as she reached toward the light. A soft gasp rippled through the crowd, a sound that had not been heard in the city for generations. Tears began to track through the dust on her cheeks, leaving paths of silver in the blue glow. Alice watched from the ramp, her heart heavy with the realization that this was more than just a search for a missing artifact. Every world she visited was a piece of a broken soul, and she was the one who had to mend it. The Golden Spool was not just a tool; it was the hope of every living thing in the nebula.
