Chapter 17: Allies Reunited

The Primary Aperture was a storm of jagged shadows, but I stood my ground, my paws trembling as I fought to keep the Fluff-Voyager steady. Just as the obsidian static threatened to overwhelm my shields, my long-range scanners flared to life with a familiar, melodic chime. Barnaby and the fleet from the Sofa Nebula dropped out of warp, their ships glowing with the soft, warm light of repurposed Lint Mines.

"We are here, Alice!" Barnaby shouted over the comms, his voice a beacon of hope in the digital screaming. The mismatched fleet formed a protective circle around me, their beams of light cutting through the darkness like a new dawn. With my friends guarding my back, I turned my full attention to the Prism Heart, my markings glowing with a steady, defiant blue. I felt the stabilization sequence finally take hold as the Lint Mines neutralized the static, creating a pocket of calm in the center of the digital cyclone. We were not just surviving anymore; we were fighting back.
