Chapter 17: Allies Reunited

The Primary Aperture was a storm of jagged shadows, but Alice stood her ground. Just as the static threatened to overwhelm her shields, the long-range scanners flared to life. Barnaby and the fleet from the Sofa Nebula dropped out of warp, their ships glowing with the soft light of repurposed Lint Mines. 'We are here, Alice!' Barnaby shouted over the channel. The mismatched fleet formed a protective circle, their beams of light cutting through the obsidian darkness. With her friends guarding her, Alice turned her full attention back to the Prism Heart, her paws glowing with a steady, defiant blue. The stabilization sequence began to take hold as the Lint Mines neutralized the static, creating a pocket of calm in the center of the digital cyclone.
