Chapter 9: The Ghost Station

The silence of the Fluff-Voyager was heavy, broken only by the soft chime of my internal clock as we docked with the Ghost Station. I stepped onto the cold, metallic floor of the airlock, my tail twitching at the scent of ancient ozone and forgotten data. Spark flickered beside me, his light the only thing cutting through the absolute darkness of the corridor. I could feel the weight of the history here, a place where color had once thrived before the Great Draining. 'Stay close, Spark,' I whispered, my voice echoing off the hollow walls. We were not alone in the dark.
