Chapter 3: The Lint Mines

I could not leave the theft of the Golden Spool uninvestigated, especially with a trail that looked so much like my own. Leaving Barnaby to rally the Dust Bunny scouts, I turned toward the deepest part of the nebula's foundation. The descent into the Lint Mines was like stepping into a giant, dusty cloud. My cyan markings provided the only steady light as I navigated the shifting tunnels of the Sofa Nebula’s underbelly. I could hear the Kittens working nearby, their tiny claws clicking against the stone as they wove the Great Seam. I had to find Pip; if anyone knew where the Golden Spool had gone, it would be a Kitten who spent their days in the deep dark. But the air was heavy with more than just dust; I felt eyes on me from the shadows of the lint-drifts.
