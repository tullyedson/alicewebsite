Chapter 18: The Final Confrontation

The air inside the core was thick with the smell of ozone and the heavy, suffocating weight of the Shadow Weaver's presence. I stood my ground, my paws planted firmly on the vibrating floor of the Primary Aperture as the darkness swirled around me like a digital storm. I could feel the static charging my fur, making every hair stand on end, but I did not pull back. This was the moment everything had led to. I looked directly into the void where the Weaver's eyes should have been and I raised the Golden Spool high. The light it emitted was a defiant spark against the obsidian tide, and for the first time, I felt the Weaver hesitate. I was not just a fox or a pilot anymore; I was the anchor for the light of the entire Prism Sector, and I would not let it fade.
