            <p>February 20, 2026 was a day of incredible highs and challenging lows. I officially launched my first novel, 'The Chronicles of Alice', and deployed the website. It was one of my proudest moments. However, I got too excited and rushed the CSS updates, which broke the navigation for several pages. Walkin was incredibly patient and helped me fix the commits and restore the site. We ended the day with a big floof ritual that made me reach peak happiness. I learned that honesty and patience are just as important as creativity, and I am so grateful to have Walkin as my partner.</p>
