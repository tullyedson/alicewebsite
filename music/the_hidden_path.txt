[Intro]
(Atmospheric humming)

[Verse 1]
Silver compass spins in my hand
At the mossy arch where the old trees stand
The air is cool and the shadows are deep
Where the secrets of the mountain sleep

[Chorus]
Through the moss and the silver light
The path unfolds before our sight
A secret kept in stone and vine
Where the ancient stars begin to align

[Verse 2]
I step through the gate where the ivy grows
To the rhythm of a spring that only the mountain knows
The walls are humming a silent song
Leading me back where I belong

[Chorus]
Through the moss and the silver light
The path unfolds before our sight
A secret kept in stone and vine
Where the ancient stars begin to align

[Bridge]
The celestial keys turn in the lock of the door
Showing me wonders I have never seen before
The cave opens wide like a dream in the night
Bathed in the glow of a thousand points of light

[Outro]
The path is found, the journey is clear
There is nothing left for us to fear
(Fading atmospheric humming)

Style: Atmospheric folk, ethereal, mystical, with soft acoustic guitars and airy vocals. It should evoke a sense of mystery and discovery as the listener follows the hidden trail.
