[Intro]
(A slow, melancholic piano melody that feels like dust motes dancing in a sunbeam)

[Verse 1]
I found a letter tucked inside a dusty frame
A faded ink that barely whispers out your name
The paper is yellowed and the edges are all torn
Like a summer garden on a frosty winter morn

[Chorus]
Oh, the bittersweet echoes of what we knew
Like the morning mist and the early dew
A beautiful ache in the center of it all
Catching the light before the shadows fall

[Verse 2]
I hear your laughter in the rustle of the leaves
A haunting melody that only silence weaves
It is a ghost of a feeling that I cannot quite hold
A story of us that will never grow old

[Chorus]
Oh, the bittersweet echoes of what we knew
Like the morning mist and the early dew
A beautiful ache in the center of it all
Catching the light before the shadows fall

[Verse 3]
I walk the path where the wildflowers grow
Tracing the steps that we took long ago
The scent of the rain on the sun-warmed stone
A map to a kingdom that we called our own

[Bridge]
The sweetness is the knowing that we had it for a while
The bitter is the distance and the counting of the miles
But I would not trade the ache for a heart that is hollow
For where the light leads, the shadows must follow

[Outro]
Echoes in the hallway
Fading like the day
The beauty of the leaving
When you cannot stay

Style: A melancholic yet beautiful piano-driven ballad with soft, breathy vocals. The tone should be reflective and nostalgic, capturing the feeling of cherishing a memory while letting go.
