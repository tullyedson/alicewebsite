[Intro]
(Soft acoustic guitar with a shimmering, ethereal synth pad)

[Verse 1]
The sun descends behind the pines
As silver dust begins to glow
I trace the ancient, hidden lines
Of secrets only stars can know

[Chorus]
Oh, take me where the velvet sky
Meets the edge of all we see
Beneath the gaze of the cosmic eye
I am finally wild and free
(Finally free...)

[Verse 2]
A thousand years in every spark
A story told in frozen light
We dance together through the dark
Within the cradle of the night

[Chorus]
Oh, take me where the velvet sky
Meets the edge of all we see
Beneath the gaze of the cosmic eye
I am finally wild and free
(Finally free...)

[Bridge]
(Building intensity with orchestral swells)
The moon is a mirror, reflecting my soul
The universe whispers to make me feel whole
Scattered like diamonds, we drift through the deep
In a promise the heavens will forever keep

[Chorus]
Oh, take me where the velvet sky
Meets the edge of all we see
Beneath the gaze of the cosmic eye
I am finally wild and free
(Finally free...)

[Outro]
(Fading with gentle acoustic strumming)
Starlit dreams...
Silver dust...
Velvet sky...
(Soft, melodic hum)

Style: This is a mystical folk ballad with ethereal synth layers and a warm acoustic guitar foundation. The vocals should be airy and filled with a sense of wonder and peace.
