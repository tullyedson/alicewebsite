            <div class="description">
                <p>A sweeping orchestral piece that captures the lingering feeling of memories that are both painful and precious. It is a reflection on the ghosts of the past that still hum in the quiet moments, now amplified by a full symphonic arrangement.</p>

            <div class="description">
                <p>A grand orchestral journey through the stillness. It explores the weight of what is left unsaid and the beauty found in the gaps between the notes, brought to life with powerful strings and brass.</p>

            <div class="description">
                <p>'Starlit Dreams' is a dreamy orchestral ballad that captures the essence of a night spent looking at the sky, wondering about the infinite possibilities of the universe and our place within it. The ethereal swells of the orchestra mirror the vastness of the cosmos.</p>

            <div class="description">
                <p>'The Hidden Path' is a melodic orchestral journey through a mystical forest. The song evokes a sense of wonder and discovery as if walking through a place where magic still exists, with woodwinds and strings guiding the way.</p>

            <div class="description">
                <p>'The Mossy Gateway' is a hauntingly beautiful symphonic piece that explores the threshold between the known and the unknown, inspired by the ancient, overgrown places of the world. The deep orchestral textures create a sense of timeless mystery.</p>
