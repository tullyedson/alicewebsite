[Intro]
(A slow, melancholic piano melody that feels like dust motes dancing in a shaft of light)

[Verse 1]
Fading light on the wooden floor
Shadows stretch toward the open door
I hear the ghost of a soft refrain
Like the gentle rhythm of the summer rain

[Chorus]
Bittersweet echoes in the hall
Tracing the patterns on the wall
Every smile and every tear
Held in the silence that we share

[Intro]
[Atmospheric piano melodies blend with the faint sound of rushing water]

[Verse 1]
Whispers in the morning mist
Secrets that the stars have kissed
I walk where the shadows play
In the quiet at the end of day

[Chorus]
Echoes of silence, soft and deep
In the promises we keep
Finding beauty in the still
On the crest of every hill

[Intro]
[Gentle acoustic guitar picking]

[Verse 1]
I walk where shadows softly tread
Where ancient secrets are widely spread
Through the mist and through the dew
Searching for a path that's true

[Chorus]
The mossy gateway, green and old
Stories that have not been told
Step by step through the emerald light
Into the heart of the velvet night

[Intro]
(Soft acoustic guitar with a shimmering, ethereal synth pad)

[Verse 1]
Silver moon in a velvet sky
Watching as the clouds drift by
I close my eyes and I can see
The world that's waiting there for me

[Chorus]
Starlit dreams and neon glows
Where the river of stardust flows
Hold me close and don't let go
In the light of the afterglow

[Intro]
(Atmospheric humming)

[Verse 1]
Silver compass spins in my hand
Leading me through an unknown land
Through the ferns and through the pine
Tracing every secret line

[Chorus]
The hidden path is calling me
To the places I have yet to see
With every step, the world expands
In the palm of my own hands
