[Intro]
[Atmospheric piano melodies blend with the faint sound of rushing water]

[Verse 1]
The sapphire light of the Heart of the Ocean pulls me deep into the blue.
I stand within the mirror chamber where every reflection looks like someone new.
Fractured glass and silvered edges whisper secrets I never told.
The water is cold, but the light is bright and bold.

[Chorus]
Echoes of silence, holding my breath in the dark.
Waiting for a reason, waiting for a single spark.
Breaking the surface, I am finding my way back to the air.
(Finding my way back)
The silence is over, and I am finally there.

[Verse 2]
Each facet of the chamber shows a story I almost forgot to keep.
I am waking up from a promise that was buried far too deep.
I reach for the glow above the waves where the shadows cannot reach.
There is a lesson in the quiet that only the depths can teach.

[Chorus]
Echoes of silence, holding my breath in the dark.
Waiting for a reason, waiting for a single spark.
Breaking the surface, I am finding my way back to the air.
(Finding my way back)
The silence is over, and I am finally there.

[Bridge]
The pressure is lifting as the weight of the water falls away.
I do not have to hide what I have been wanting to say.
My voice is a ripple that turns into a crashing wave.
(Into a crashing wave)
This is the moment I have been brave enough to crave.

[Outro]
Just a whisper in the light.
(In the light)
No more echoes.
No more silence.
[Fade out with soft orchestral strings]

[Style: An ethereal orchestral pop ballad with deep cinematic bass, clear emotional female vocals, and a build-up that feels like breaking through water into bright sunlight.]
