[Intro]
[Gentle acoustic guitar picking]

[Verse 1]
I walk where shadows turn to gold
Between the stories never told
The velvet path beneath my feet
Where silence and the spirit meet

[Chorus]
The mossy gateway calls my name
A world that never stays the same
In the green and quiet light
I find my way through day and night

[Verse 2]
The ancient oaks reach for the sky
While all the heavy years go by
I feel the pulse of earth and stone
In this place I call my own

[Chorus]
The mossy gateway calls my name
A world that never stays the same
In the green and quiet light
I find my way through day and night

[Bridge]
Breathe it in the scent of pine
Where the wild and heart entwine
Everything I used to know
Softly starts to let it go

[Outro]
[Slow fading hum]
(Deep in the moss...)
(I am home...)

[Style]
An emotional indie-folk song with a warm acoustic guitar and a soft, intimate female vocal. The atmosphere is peaceful, grounded, and slightly magical.
